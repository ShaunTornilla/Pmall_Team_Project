Project Files for Pmall Computer Database + Others

DESC:
==========

An idea to create a database of pmall's 2000 computers to manage and navigate in a functional UI had been agreed onto
attempt to develop. Various functions such as displaying a computer's status/specs to remote shutdowns in the UI had been
brainstormed. Additional information can be found on the OneDrive (link will be provided).

The README will also be a source for various information on potential snags during development. Directions on how to resolve
should others run into it can be provided here. Misc. information may also be found on here as well.

RECOMMENDED: You will be prompted to "Install SSMS" after installing the SQL Server stuff. For users looking to manipulate things within the server directly, I would probably recommend it. Link below:
